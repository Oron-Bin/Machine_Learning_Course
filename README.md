## Introduction
This course aims to equip learners with the knowledge and skills required to understand and apply machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and projects, students will learn how to build and evaluate machine learning models.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of machine learning. Each module includes lecture notes, code examples, and assignments to reinforce learning.

## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this course, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental mathematical concepts (algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics)

## Installation
To set up the course materials on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-course.git
    cd machine-learning-course
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
